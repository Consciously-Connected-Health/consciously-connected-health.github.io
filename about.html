  <p class="bio-start"><b>I am here because I am human,</b> and I’ve struggled with my mental and physical health - let’s be real, I still struggle. And I’m guessing that’s what brings you here as well (I’m so glad you’re here by the way!).</p>

  <p>BECAUSE I’ve been through challenges in my overall health, I’m able to coach and guide from experience. Personally, I think this makes the best kind of coach. Of course I haven’t lived your exact and unique perspective, and I won’t pretend I have. However, I know the road and I’m here to support and guide you on YOUR path towards healing.</p>

  <section class="my-journey">
    <h3>I’ve been on my own health journey since 2015…</h3>
    <p>One that has been characterized by countless doctors and practitioners, medical tests, supplements, dietary changes and restrictions, and wondering if I’d ever feel “good” again. I was obsessed with finding answers and trying to fix what was wrong with me. Yes these years were associated with a lot of overall pain and discomfort, but they have also led to some incredible self-discovery, personal growth, and a deeper connection to myself and my life.</p>
    <p class="fancy">Most importantly, it brought me here, to you.</p>

      <h2 class="fancy">My beliefs about health</h2>
      <div class="list">
        <p>I believe health is a unique state of being, not a universal destination. It should serve as a foundation to support everything else in your life - the springboard that propels you into the very best version of yourself!</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I believe health is not only about the what (what you eat, what you do for exercise, what your self-care practices consist of, etc.), but HOW you do all these things is equally important.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I believe everything in life is connected. Just look at nature! Everything serves a purpose and has an influence over, and in return is influenced by, everything else. Our bodies and our health are no different.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I believe if we want to understand ourselves, we have to connect and dig deeper on all levels - mind, body, soul. We have to understand the connection between our thoughts, feelings, emotions, physical sensations, actions, behavior, etc. It starts with developing self-awareness and a sense of personal responsibility.</p>
