        <h3>Hi, it's me!</h3>
        <p>I’m Aly and I’m a certified Integrative Nutrition Health Coach.</p>
        <p>What excites me the most is the opportunity to help you cultivate a deeper connection to yourself and the world around you, so that you feel capable and empowered to actively create the life you desire. No one’s path, goals, or process looks the same, because no two people are exactly the same… and I find that absolutely beautiful.</p>
        <p>Of course our journeys won’t always be a steady uphill climb, and I’m sure if you’re here right now, you’re all too familiar with the dips and turns that require you to re-adjust and leave you feeling a little unsure of everything. I’ve been there, and I know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed by your health and what to do next.</p>
