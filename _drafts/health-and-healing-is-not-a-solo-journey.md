Health and healing shouldn’t be a solo journey. In fact, it can’t be. ⁣

We are complex, unique, and social beings. ⁣

⁣

Yes you can acquire all the information and wisdom from other people… You can be told all the things and given all the tools and resources… But until you start applying these things in your life and making the changes on an internal level, there will be no transformation. You and only you dictate where your life will go and the version of yourself you embody at any given moment. So the responsibility is on you - It’s up to you to decide, apply, and act. ⁣

⁣

HOWEVER (and that’s a big however) - it does NOT mean you need to navigate your health and healing on your own. And I highly advise that you don’t even try it. ⁣

⁣

It is vital to have support and accountability through it all.⁣

⁣

#### Find your team

Maybe it consists of a doctor, a masseuse, a therapist, a close friend, a spouse or other family member, a coach, a community, etc. As many individuals that you need, and ones that you trust and are aligned to you and your values. ⁣

⁣

#### Learn to ask for help when you need it

Both big and small things can be equally challenging to vocalize that we need help, but both are significant. Opinions, guidance, emotional and physical support, household chores, staying accountable, motivation, etc. These are all things that might require you to vocalize your truth and speak up for what you are needing. ⁣

⁣

You are worthy and capable. Having help is not a sign of weakness, but a display of strength and empowerment. ⁣
